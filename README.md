## Installation
- `git clone`
- `npm i`
- `bower i`

## Running it in development/watch mode
```
npm run start
```

## Tools and technologies
- `Gulp` for the build system
- `Webpack` because I :heart: `require()` on the front-end and :heart: `babel-loader` too
- `ES6` because arrow functions are :+1:
- `React` because declarative interfaces make me :smirk:
- `Immutable.js` just to be sure I'm not accidentally mutating objects :boom:
- `window.fetch` polyfill to make me believe it's already there
- `Velocity` to slide it and shake it on demand
- `Standard` js code style to give it a try
- And also some inline styling so there's something to fight about :grin:
- ...

## TODO
- Build script to create the production folder
- Testing React components with `Jest`
- UX/UI glitches
- Buy a selfie stick
